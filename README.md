# Vehicle Price Prediction App

## 🚗 Project Overview

This is a **Vehicle Price Prediction Application** powered by Machine Learning. It helps users estimate the market value of a used car based on various parameters like year of purchase, current showroom price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.

The application features a **Flask** backend that serves a trained **Random Forest Regressor** model and a modern, premium **HTML/CSS/JS** frontend with a Glassmorphism design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Backend**: Python, Flask
-   **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Pipeline, Preprocessing), Pandas, Joblib
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Glassmorphism), JavaScript (Fetch API)
-   **Data Source**: Automated ingestion from GitHub Raw URL.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

This project is designed to be simple and automated. You do **not** need to manually download data or run multiple scripts. The entire process is handled by two main commands.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the project files.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd vehicle-price-prediction
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 1: Automated Training (One-Time Setup)

To prepare the application, run the following command. This single script will automatically:
1.  **Download** the dataset from the internet.
2.  **Clean and Process** the data.
3.  **Train** the Machine Learning model.
4.  **Save** the trained model as `model.pkl`.

```bash
python -m core.utils.train_model
```

*Wait for the message: "Model saved to model.pkl".*

### Step 2: Run the Application

Once the model is trained, start the web server:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Usage

1.  Open your web browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
2.  Fill in the vehicle details in the form.
3.  Click **"Predict Price"**.
4.  The estimated price will appear instantly.
